    <section id="Verse1">
        <h2>Verse 1:</h2>
       <p>  Every day, I imagine a future where I can be with you
            In my hand is a pen that will write a poem of me and you.
            The ink flows down into a dark puddle
            Just move your hand, the way into his heart.
            But in this world of infinite choices
            What will it take just to find that special day?
            What will it take just to find that special day?
</p>

    <!--Verse 2-->
    <section id="Verse2">
        <h2>Verse 2:</h2>
       <p>  Have I found everybody a fun assignment to do today?
            When you're here, everything that we do is fun for them anyway
            When I can't even read my own feelings
            What good are words when a smile says it all?
            And if this world won't write me an ending
            What will it take just for me to have it all?
</p>
    </section>
    <!--Verse 3-->
    <section id="Verse3">
        <h2>Verse 3:</h2>
        <p> Does my pen only write bitter words for those who are dear to me?
            Is it love if I take you, or is it love if I set you free?
            The ink flows down into a dark puddle
            How can I write love into reality?
            If I can't hear the sound of your heartbeat
            What do you call love in your reality?
            And in your reality, if I don't know how to love you
            I'll leave you be...
